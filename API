NAME

	lib_mysqludf_dom

DESCRIPTION
	
	UDF libraries for dom manipulation with XML strings.
	Replaces standard ExtractValue and UpdateXML functions,
	using libxml2 library. Adds support of xpath standard
	and namespaces.

ERROR HANDLING

	Mysql UDF function able to report error detected at query 
	parsing stage. If errors occurs at execution stage 
	(row-specific error), any of dom_* functions returns NULL 
	instead of marking *err pointer. 
	This does not correspond to UDF manual, but allows you to 
	determine which rows the function failed to handle.

FUNCTIONS

	dom_xpath(xml, xpath, ns_string)
	
	Evaluates xpath expression agains xml, then casts result
	of xpath evaluation to string, using libxml's
	xmlXPathCastToString() function. Note, this function
	does not returns XML, just a string. If you need to get
	XML representation of some node - use dom_extract_node

	dom_extract_node(xml, xpath, ns_string)

	Extract node, pointed by xpath. If result of xpath is node set, 
	containing more or less than one node, funtion will return error. 
	If node is an element, function returns well-formed xml, 
	otherwise it returns textual representation of the node. 

	dom_delete_node(xml, xpath, ns_string)

	Delete all nodes, pointed by xpath document. Returns 
	well-formed xml, representing new document.

	dom_replace_node(xml, xpath, ns_string, value)
	dom_replace_node(xml, xpath, ns_string, value AS TEXT)
	dom_replace_node(xml, xpath, ns_string, value AS XML)
	
	Replaces all nodes, pointed by xpath with value. By default, or
	if TEXT name for value argument specified, value inserted 
	in dom just as text node, regardless of content of the value. 
	If value argument passed with XML name, it will be parsed as 
	XML document and will be inserted in dom as subtree.
	Returns well-fromed xml, representing new document.

	dom_append_child(xml, xpath, ns_string, value)
	dom_append_child(xml, xpath, ns_string, value AS TEXT)
	dom_append_child(xml, xpath, ns_string, value AS XML)

	Appends a child to all nodes pointed by xpath. Handling of
	XML name of 4th argument is the same. XML means that we should
	try to parse value and insert in as subtree.
	Returns well-formed xml, representing new document.

NAMESPACE SYNTAX
	
	All functions accpets ns_string, containing namespace - prefix
	mapping for xpath context.

	Ns string contains one or more ns_pairs
	Each ns_pair - is ordinary xml ns declaration
	ns_pairs are separated by any blank characters

	Example:
	'xmlns:a = "one_ns"    xmlns:prefix1="some1" xmlns:prefix2="some2"'
	binds namespaces "one_ns" with prefix "a" and so on..
